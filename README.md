# Ridesharing-Simulation

## Overview

A simulation testbed for evaluating ride-sharing (single-passenger) and ride-hailing (multi-passenger) strategies.

The simulation offers the option for 3 distinct ridesharing strategies:
1. Closest - Passengers served based on spatially closest passenger to available driver
2. Waiting - Passengers prioritiesed according to their latest possible pick up time
3. Queue - Passengers served on FIFO basis
